<b>Command to install package</b><br/>
npm install sort-view<br/><br/>

Sorting algorithms can be complex to understand merely by looking at their code. Visualizations in command-prompt provide a graphical representation of how the algorithm works step by step, making it easier to understand the underlying logic and behavior.<br/><br/>

<b>Key points to remember while using visualisation</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Array length should be less than 10 for visualization</li>
<li>Visualization works best when numbers are in the range 0 to 9</li>
</ul>

<b>Available methods: </b><br/>

1. bubblesort(array, view = boolean)<br/>
    This function takes 2 arguments where the view argument is optional to view how the sort is working at each step. The first argument is an array. The function returns a sorted array using bubblesort.
    <br/>

2. insertionsort(array, view = boolean)<br/>
    This function takes 2 arguments where the view argument is optional to view how the sort is working at each step. The first argument is an array. The function returns a sorted array using insertionsort.
